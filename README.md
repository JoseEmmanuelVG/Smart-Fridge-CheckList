  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>Design a model applying object-oriented programming paradigm concepts to create an application related to Industry 4.0 and, in particular, the Internet of Things.</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>This document provides an explanation of the basic functioning of the project proposal, demonstrating the model design using the OOP paradigm and the necessary Java SWING interfaces. The document concludes with findings, results, and observations after completing the second stage of the project.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Currently, people lack good home management habits as technology advances. With the introduction of Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things (IoT), we can automate tedious, time-consuming, and difficult tasks. This project utilizes the OOP paradigm and leverages the advantages of Java Swing to create a system that automates various household tasks.</p>

  <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a software design methodology and programming paradigm that defines programs in terms of "classes and objects," where objects combine state (data) and behavior (methods).</p>

  <h3>Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm</h3>
  <p>In the object-oriented programming paradigm, problem-solving involves modeling the problem as a set of objects that interact with each other.</p>

  <h3>Introduction to the Object Concept</h3>
  <p>An object, in a computer program, represents an entity that combines identity, state, and behavior.</p>

  <h3>SWING</h3>
  <p>SWING is a set of components developed for designing a Graphical User Interface (GUI).</p>

  <h3>GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE (GUI)</h3>
  <p>A means through which a user interacts with a computer application. An interface consists of constants and abstract methods. All interfaces are abstract, and their methods are public and abstract.</p>

  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
  <p>What classes are needed to form the project model, and what are the steps for its implementation?</p>

  <h2>Development</h2>
  <p>To develop the project model, follow these steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Run the application development environment (e.g., Java Application).</li>
    <li>Create a new project and follow the necessary steps.</li>
    <li>Create a new class within the project.</li>
    <li>Name the class and choose the destination location.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Creating Classes</h3>
  <p>This project uses the following base classes (Note: Classes may be edited, deleted, or new classes added as the project progresses).</p>

  <h2>Class Diagram</h2>

  <h3>Main Class</h3>
  <p>The Main class executes both console code and the application with interfaces. It creates connections and methods to link the previously mentioned classes.</p>
  <h2>Functionality</h2>
  <p>The current project functionality can be found at the end of this report in a video</p>

  <h2>Results and Conclusions</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, a console source code fulfilling the project's base requirements was obtained. The system's methodology was developed using class creation and their linkage with the OOP paradigm. Necessary interfaces were implemented for effective navigation in the application.</p>
